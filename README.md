# mojo-num-analysis

Numerical analysis and algorithms for numerical linear algebra written in Mojo. This project is inspired by [Justin Solomon's lectures on Mathematical Methods for Robotics, Vision, and Graphics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ3UicqQtfNvQ_VzflHYKhAqZiTxOkSwi). His book can be found [here](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/share/book/numerical_book.pdf).
